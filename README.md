# Škoda Android App Project

## Overview
The Škoda Android Automotive App is designed for use in Škoda vehicles, enhancing the driving experience by integrating key vehicle features directly into the car's infotainment system. This app is built specifically for Android Automotive OS, focusing on safety, vehicle status monitoring, and infotainment integration.

One of the main functionalities is for car rental companies to receive notifications if a renter drives over a pre-set speed limit. Different customers can have different speed limits, which can be configured before the rental period starts. The app issues a warning alert to the driver and sends a notification to the rental company when the speed limit is exceeded. 

The app's user interface includes a speedometer, overspeed alert, fuel meter, door status, and engine start/stop controls.
